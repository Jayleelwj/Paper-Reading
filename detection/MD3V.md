# Multi-View 3D Objection Detection Network for Autonomous Driving

---

## Main Points:

* Goal:  
  * Input: LIDAR point cloud + RGB Images; 
  * Predict: oriented 3D bounding boxes
* Method:
  * 3D object proposal generation: bird-view representation -&gt; 3D candidate boxes
  * multi-view feature fusion



1. 3D Point Cloud Representation
2. 3D Proposal Network
   1. parameters for one 3D box \(x, y, z, l, w, h\)
3. s
